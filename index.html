<h1>How to Get a Pixel-Perfect, Linearly Scaled UI</h1>
<p>But what if we really do want pixel perfection? What if, let’s say, we are developing a complex real-time analytics
    dashboard to be viewed on large TVs at a conference room or as some PWA to be opened exclusively on mobile and
    tablet devices, as opposed to text-heavy blogs and news websites? Those are cases where we need more precision.</p>
<h2>Scaling our UI</h2>
<p>This design was created with a container that’s 1600px wide. Let’s assume that at 1600px, the ideal font size for the
    titles of the cards should be 16px since that’s how it’s designed.</p>
<p>As you can see, we treat the ideal font size we obtained from the design as a base and multiply it by the difference
    between the current and ideal viewport widths. How does this look mathematically? Let’s say we are viewing this web
    app on a screen with the exact same width as the mockup</p>
<h2>Clamping the min and max viewport width</h2>
<p>Using this current approach, the design scales to match the viewport size, no matter how big or small the viewport
    gets. We can prevent this with CSS clamp() which allows us to set a minimum width of 350px and maximum width of
    3840px. This means that if we are to open the web app on a device with 5000px width, our layout will stay locked at
    3840px</p>
